NAME
----
lottery - Generate random numbers without repetition

SYNOPSIS
--------
*lottery* [_count_ [_first_ [_last_]]]

*lottery* *-h*|*-?*

*lottery* *-v*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Generates _count_ numbers (default: 6), starting from _first_, up to _last_
(default: from 1 to 60). The numbers generated are printed on a single line. The
generated numbers will be uniformly distributed.

The _count_ argument must be a positive number and chooses how many random
numbers are generated. The generated numbers never repeat. The _first_ and
_last_ arguments must be unsigned 64-bit numbers. Both _first_ and _last_ are
included in the range and may appear in the results. The _first_ argument must
be smaller than _last_. The minimum possible result range is 2, when _last_ is
one more than _first_ and the maximum is 1048576 (slightly more than 1 million).
The requested _count_ must be smaller than the requested range.

The random values are generated with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random
number generator (CSPRNG), seeded by the operating system supplied entropy
source.

Option arguments are the following:

*-h*, *-?*::
  Show help message instead of generating random numbers.
*-v*::
  Show program version number instead of generating random numbers.

EXAMPLES
--------
Generate 6 numbers for a lottery ticket, ranging from 1 to 60:

    $ lottery
    42 51 18 40 59 30

Generate 5 numbers, from 100 to 159:

    $ lottery 5 100 159
    142 125 109 127 159

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure (syntax or usage error; any I/O error; entropy system call error).

CRYPTANALYSIS
-------------
Current code utilizes an implementation of the 20-round Chacha20 cipher with
native-endian 32-bit integer numbers (it does not consider numbers to be
little-endian). The code was not reviewed by a cryptanalist.
