NAME
----
roll - Generate 64-bit random numbers

SYNOPSIS
--------
*roll* [_OPTION_] (_x_|__x__d__y__)...

*roll* *-h*|*-?*

*roll* *-v*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Generates random numbers uniformly within a range, by default from 1 to 6. The
program accepts multiple parameters to specify different amounts and ranges. For
each parameter given, the corresponding generated values are printed in a single
line, with values separated by spaces, if the requested amount is larger than
one.

The number of values to be generated may be specified with the _x_ parameter and
must positive. If both the number of values and the range need be specified,
then the parameter should have a number _x_ for the count, followed by the ``d''
character, followed by the range size, _y_ (this is similar to the common RPG
dice notation). For example, to generate 3 numbers from 1 to 10, the parameter
is ``3d10''. The range may be any positive 64-bit value and includes the initial
and final values.

The random values are generated with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random
number generator (CSPRNG), seeded by the operating system supplied entropy
source, so it can be used in more situations than more common pseudo-random
number generators. There's no option to change this behavior, using a CSPRNG is
guaranteed.

Option arguments are used to modify the output format. If multiple options with
conflicting formats appear in the command line, the initial ones are ignored and
the last ones are used. The list of options follows:

*-d*::
  Print Unicode dice characters instead of numeric output, with the dice faces
  indicating the numeric value. The range must be at most 6. Smaller ranges omit
  the higher valued rolls. The characters are always encoded in the UTF-8
  format.
*-c*::
  Print Unicode French deck characters instead of numeric output. The range must
  be at most 13. For the purpose of range selection, the cards are considered to
  have values between 1 and 13, in the following order: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
  8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. Smaller ranges omit the higher valued cards. The
  characters are always encoded in the UTF-8 format. The suits on the cards are
  random andd may be one of: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds or Clubs.
*-h*, *-?*::
  Show help message instead of generating random numbers.
*-v*::
  Show program version number instead of generating random numbers.

EXAMPLES
--------
Generate a number between 1 and 6:

    $ roll
    4

Generate 3 numbers between 1 and 6 and 1 number between 1 and 20:

    $ roll 3d6 1d20
    3 6 3
    19

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure (syntax or usage error; any I/O error; entropy system call error).

CRYPTANALYSIS
-------------
Current code utilizes an implementation of the 20-round Chacha20 cipher with
native-endian 32-bit integer numbers (it does not consider numbers to be
little-endian). The code was not reviewed by a cryptanalist.
